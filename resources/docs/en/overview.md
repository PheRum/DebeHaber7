## Registration

Registering a new account, will also create a new team. You will automatically be assigned as the owner of this team. As such it's important that the person in charge of the team create the account first and then invite the remaining members.

### Inviting other Members

Once the account is created, you can send invites to the other users and assign roles to each one. The invites will be sent by email with a special link to register the new member under your team.

Note: It's important that other members don't create their own accounts.

Roles help limit the interaction a user has with your data. These are the
- Administrator Role: Has full control over all data and membership.
- Data-Entry Role: Has full control over the data.
- Data-View Role: Can view data.

Invitations are meant to be shared with members within your organization. Do not share invites with Accountants, Auditors, or Consultants as they should create their own account and request data access to specific taxpayers.
