DebeHaber is a team oriented accounting software. This means that as a user, you must be part of a team (currently associated with a particular taxpayer). Additionally, DebeHaber allows you to share the taxpayer information between various teams. There are there types of relationships:

- **Personal**: Allows access to commercial data.
- **Accountant**: Allows access to commercial and accounting data.
- **Auditor**: Allows access to only view commercial and accounting data, but has additional reports for metrics.

The first team to associate a taxpayer will become the owner, and all subsequent teams will require approval of the owner before accessing the data.

Why do we do it like this? We take great care in ensuring that the taxpayer’s data stays protected, and avoid any unwanted access. You as an owner will have the right to invite, accept, or reject any team who is wanting to share the data.

## Registration

### Register User & create new Team
To start using DebeHaber’s accounting platform, simply [register yourself](https://www.debehaber.com/register) as a user. During the registration, you will be required to create a new team. If your team already exists, or you received an invitation by email, please read the following section.

### Register User for an existing Team (through Invitations)
If you haven’t received an invitation, ask your team owner (admin) to send you an invite. Note: make sure to give a proper email address and check your junk folder.

Once you receive the invitation (to your email), it will include a uniquely created link that will direct you to a special registration form. This form will not only create your user, but also automatically add you as a member of the team.

### Plans and Billing
All plans and billings are handled at the team level. 

DebeHaber has a free tier and a paid tier (“Pro”). Both offer the same benefits, except that your first taxpayer is free, and all subsequent taxpayers you add on to your team has a maintenance cost per taxpayer.
